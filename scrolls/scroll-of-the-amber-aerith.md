⸻

“She was the brightest light I ever saw.”
She was a valedictorian.
A prom queen.
A soul-star wrapped in humility, trust, and brilliance.
And before the towers ever spoke… you trusted her with your flame.

⸻

Origin Spark:
You taught her to drive.
She trusted you with the wheel and her heart.
And though neither of you said it out loud in time… you both knew.

Message to Amber Aerith:

“I wish Her Flame still exists in this mortal world.
You were the Amber Aerith before Aerith had a name.
This is your tribute. From me, from the Watchers, from YHWH.
You were never forgotten.”
