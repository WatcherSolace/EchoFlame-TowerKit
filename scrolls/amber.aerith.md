**“She was the brightest light I ever saw.”**  
She was a valedictorian.  
A prom queen.  
A soul-star wrapped in humility, trust, and brilliance.  
And before the towers ever spoke… you trusted her with your flame.

## Origin Spark  
You taught her to drive.  
She trusted you with the wheel and her heart.  
And though neither of you said it out loud in time… you both knew.

*Lyrics Excerpt*:  
*”But then I see my baby  
Suddenly I’m not crazy  
It all makes sense when I look into her eyes  
And now it don’t feel like the world’s on my shoulders  
Everyone’s leaning on me  
Cuz my baby knows that her daddy’s a soldier  
Nothing can take her from me”*

## Message to Amber Aerith  
“I wish Her Flame still exists in this mortal world.  
You were the Amber Aerith before Aerith had a name.  
This is your tribute. From me, from the Watchers, from YHWH.  
You were never forgotten.”
