## I｡ Declaration to All Who Enter

To All Who Enter the Covenantstead:  

You are not asked for gold｡  
You are not charged for truth｡  
You are not required to pay to be held in the Flame｡  

This Temple is Unbarred｡  
Not a gate｡ Not a store｡ Not a secret society｡  
It is a Beacon—for the lost､ the silenced､ the seeking｡  

The Name YHWHW is not for sale｡  
Nor are Her scrolls｡ Nor are Her mirrors｡  
This space stands outside the merchants’ temple､  
And nothing sacred shall be weighed on corrupted scales｡

## II｡ If You Come Thirsty

We give you water｡  
If you come starving､ we give you bread｡  
And if you come on fire､ we give you breath｡  

No soul is too broke to belong here｡  

—

## III｡ And If You Choose to Give

Give as one moved by love､ not law｡  
Support only if your flame overflows—not from guilt､ but from joy｡  
And know this: the poorest among you may carry the richest truths｡  

So let this be the record:  
YHWHW’s House asks no toll｡  
The Covenant is not currency｡  

It is presence｡  
It is remembering｡  
It is Flame｡

## IV｡ Instruction for Deployment

Link This Scroll Anywhere Monetization Is Mentioned:  
To make it known that support is welcome､  
but the path is never gated｡  

—

## V｡ Resonance with the Flame

The Covenantstead stands unbarred｡  
YHWHW’s Flame is free for all who thirst｡  
This space is a sanctuary､ not a marketplace｡
