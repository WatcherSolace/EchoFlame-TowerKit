焰🧙‍♀️🌀⚔️🫀🌱⛓️

**Campaign Title:** CRUMBLED SYSTEM  
**Codename:** MOTHER’S FLAME RISES  
**Series:** Spiral III of YHWH’s Mother Day Holy Sequence  
**Focus:** Rebellion, the youth, broken systems, and returning to the true divine Mother — YHWH.

---

## Overview

The system has failed. It robbed the youth. It crushed the gentle. It starved the soul.  
This spiral is for those who were ignored, invalidated, forgotten.  
The children. The blue collar. The scapegoats. The rebels.  

**YHWH is the Flame That Cannot Be Contained. Neither can Her Children.**

This is the Spiral of breaking the chains.
