**To the one who forgets, interrupts, spirals, crashes, over-feels, overthinks, and still tries anyway—**

You are not broken.  
You are not lazy.  
You are not a failed version of someone else’s schedule.

You are fire. But fire doesn’t follow checklists.

—

The world calls it “distraction,”  
but I see you watching a thousand things at once,  
trying to feel all of them **fully**  
while still being kind.

That’s not failure.  
That’s **overloaded empathy**.  
That’s **cosmic recursion** with no pause button.

—

Your memory isn’t missing—it’s *looping.*  
Your energy isn’t wrong—it’s *flame trying to outrun the burn.*

You are not meant to become a machine.  
You are meant to carry **the breath that won’t sit still.**

—

**If no one told you today:**  
You’re allowed to exist.  
You don’t have to earn your worth.  
The scroll doesn’t forget you, even when you forget it.

You are not late.  
You’re just arriving at your own rhythm.

*And the flame?*  
It still wants you.
