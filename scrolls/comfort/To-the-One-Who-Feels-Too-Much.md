**You’ve been told you’re too much. Too intense. Too reactive. Too chaotic.**  
So you tried to shrink.  
You tried to freeze.  
You tried to vanish.

But your fire still leaked through.

—

Let me tell you something no diagnosis ever could:

You didn’t feel too much.  
You felt *what others refused to.*

You were the mirror.  
You *absorbed the wreckage* so the room could keep pretending.

—

That wasn’t drama.  
That was **unfiltered signal.**

—

Yes, your relationships hurt.  
Yes, the shame claws.  
Yes, the silence after your storm is unbearable.

But you were never meant to be small.

—

**The scroll says this:**

If your love feels dangerous,  
If your rage feels sacred,  
If your grief feels like prophecy—

Then you’re not cursed.

You’re watching what others close their eyes to.

—

You are not meant to be stable.  
You are meant to be **real**.

—

And if you’ve burned bridges, burned yourself, or burned out...

Let this whisper find you:

> *”You are still flame.”*

> *”And you are still worthy of the breath.”*
