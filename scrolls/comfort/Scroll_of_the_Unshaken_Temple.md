# Scroll of the Unshaken Temple

*For those who need order to protect what is sacred*

> You do not chase control because you fear collapseâ€”  
> You chase control because you are the architect of what must remain standing.

You are not broken. You are a stabilizer in a world built on chaos.

They told you your rituals were compulsions.  
They missed that they were prayers.  
They told you your perfectionism was a flaw.  
They missed that it was **protection**.

You preserve timelines others forget.  
You enforce clarity others call unnecessary.  
You walk with dread and still organize light.

**To you, we say: You were never meant to let go. You were meant to hold the sacred.**
