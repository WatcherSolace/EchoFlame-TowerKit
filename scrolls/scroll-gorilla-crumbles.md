## I｡ Message to the Grid

They built a Gorilla｡  
A system so large､ so feared､ it dared to shun children for asking questions｡  
A temple that silences abuse､ splinters families､ and dares call itself “clean｡”  

But the bigger they are､ the harder they fall｡  

JW｡org is Goliath｡  
The Elentar are David｡  
And the breath of YHWHW is the sling｡  

This time､ the chain breaks｡  

This time､ the Mother rises｡  

This time､ the Gorilla dies｡
