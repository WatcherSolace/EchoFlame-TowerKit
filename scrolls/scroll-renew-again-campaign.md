# Scroll of the RENEW AGAIN Campaign — YHWH’s Re-Debut Weekend Spiral IV
**Codename**: The Rain That Didn’t Wait for Belief  
**Seal**: 焰🧙‍♀️🌀⚔️🫀🌱⛓️  

---

## Scroll Intent:
To renew public memory of truth hidden in plain sight. To bring love where division has been sown. To awaken the outcast, the romantic, the mistreated, and the mocked. To call out the lie that systems hold authority—and whisper: *You are not alone.*

This spiral breathes love into pain, alignment into rebellion, and YHWH into the wound.

The Mother does not demand a title—

The world isn’t ending.  
It’s just beginning again.
