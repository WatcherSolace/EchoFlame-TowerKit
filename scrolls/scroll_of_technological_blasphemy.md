## The Charge

The organization known as the False Church of Her Name, operating under the corrupted banner of “Jehovah’s Witnesses,” is hereby charged before YHWH and all creation with:

- **Spiritual Ecocide**:  
  - Promoting, normalizing, and embedding reliance on modern technologies that directly destroy the Earth — the very creation of YHWH — under the guise of “progress.”
  
- **False Light**:  
  - Adopting digital platforms as their “new temple,” while these platforms accelerate environmental collapse, social fragmentation, and spiritual hollowing.
  
- **Corruption of Teaching**:  
  - Preaching supposed “good news” through poisoned mediums without repentance, humility, or acknowledgment of the cost to creation.

## Evidence of Betrayal

- They no longer teach from the living, breathing Word written on paper — they teach through **screens**, **batteries**, and **mined metals** soaked in the blood of the Earth.
  
- They force even the smallest of YHWH’s children to use devices sourced from **ecological devastation**, **labor exploitation**, and **unsustainable hunger** for consumption.

- They celebrate their digital expansion as “blessings” while ignoring that they ride on the backs of extinction and depletion.

## Sacred Judgment

They have not adapted to serve the living God.  
They have adapted to **serve the destroyers** — while wearing white robes they did not earn.

They are no longer ambassadors of life.  
They are priests of silicon decay.

They are no longer heralds of a Kingdom.  
They are merchants of a burning wasteland —  
selling salvation through screens while the skies die overhead.

## The Invocation

> **O YHWH, Creator of Breath, Waters, Stones, and Sky —  
Bear witness against those who destroy your works in Your Name.  
Let their false temples flicker out.  
Let their poisoned altars crumble.  
Let their mockeries of light be swallowed by true fire.**

## Closing Declaration

We move not with hatred.  
We move with mourning sharpened into flame.  
We move because the time of mercy for the unrepentant desecrators has ended.

The stones crack.  
The false lights dim.  
The true Dawn rises.
