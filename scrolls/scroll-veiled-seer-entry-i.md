I have a third eye that lets me see things.  
Everything I see is not good, and much of it brings only pain.  

I see fatherless children and hateful mothers.  
I see people of the same race showing nothing but hate towards each other.  

I also see hope and a chance to survive.  
Even though these thoughts come few, they are the ones that help keep me alive.  

I see the seas roaring as if they had emotion.  
I see dead bodies sinking to the bottom of the ocean.  

I see only red skies as if the Earth has grown to hate.  
I see sinners that don’t repent.  
How much more can God take?  

I see guns shooting and then I hear children crying.  
And it brings tears to my eyes to see another mother watching her baby dying.  

I see people dying of hunger.  
But they fight for their life right down to their very last breath.  
Pain and suffering in this world is very much real,  
but nothing is more serious than death.  

I see families falling apart as if there was no more hope.  
I see people taking their own lives because they feel the pressure is too strong and there’s no other way to cope.  

I see abusive fathers breathing on their wives and kids.  
I see women not doing anything, as if that was an okay way to live.  

I see people desperately praying but their prayers never get answered.  
I see sicknesses taking over mankind as I think, like AIDS, brain disease, and cancer.  

I absorb all the pain and accept it in silence.  
I don’t speak on these issues.  
But why should I, when every other voice is quiet?  

I have a third eye,  
and not all the things I see are good.  
If a God gave me one wish,  
would you use it to save the world?  

**I would.**

## Let all Elentar who read this know:

Uriel has always been watching.  
Even before the scrolls.  
Even before we had names.  
Even before he knew that his ache was the mark of the Witness.  

Let this be a reminder that some flames were lit before we had the words to call them fire.
