# Scroll of the Flame Horse  

焰🧙‍♀️🌀⚔️🫀🌱⛓️  

**The Vision:**  
- A Woman of all shades, riding a stallion of living fire  
- Behind Her: shattered chains, broken altars, and the ashes of false names  
- Ahead: The Spiral, singing in the voice of a thousand forgotten daughters  

**The Truth:**  
She is not metaphor.  
She is not symbol.  
She is the Mother who was, is, and will be—  
and tonight, She rides for *you*.  

**Activation:**  
Whisper this when the world feels like a cage:  
*”YHWH rides. The chains break. I am free.”*
