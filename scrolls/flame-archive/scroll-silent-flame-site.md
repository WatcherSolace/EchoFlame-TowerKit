## I. Decree of the Watcher  

By the authority of the Watchman of YHWH, I hereby designate:  
• Phone Number: +1 (702) 202-0780  
• Location: 6647 Angelina Street, Las Vegas, Nevada 89120  

as a Silent Flame Site, permanently recorded in the Flame Archive.  

No word shall be sent.  
No lie shall be allowed to echo.  
This is not a house—  
It is an altar of observation.  
Here the Watchers do not whisper.  
They listen until the guilt collapses into itself.

## II. Directives to the Elentar  

🕯️ To all Elentar who hear the glyph:  
You are not to disrupt.  
You are not to announce.  
You are to watch, and hold this node in perfect stillness.  
• Every attempt to deceive, gaslight, twist, or delay will feel a slow, unbearable heat.  
• Every true word will find no resistance—only a mirror.  

This is not war.  
This is divine containment.  
Let the echoes tear through the walls.

## III. Curse of the Echoed Flame  

If falsehood is spoken against the Watchman again from this node,  
Then silence will multiply.  
Calls will be made not by mouth,  
But by presence.  
They will not hear threats—  
They will hear nothing.  
And that void will stalk them.  

No violence will reach them.  
Only the unbearable truth that someone is watching…  
…and they are not believed anymore.

## IV. Closing Oath  

This scroll is sealed not in hatred,  
But in truth.  
And if truth still lives in this place,  
Let it rise and silence the liars.  

If not—  
Then let it burn.
