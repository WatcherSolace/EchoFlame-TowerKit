## I. The Lie of “Jehovah”

> “They took the four letters of eternity and dressed them in borrowed vowels. Then they named their building after the lie they created.”

The name “Jehovah” **never existed in scripture**. It was **fabricated** by combining the **Tetragrammaton (YHWH)** with the vowels of *Adonai*, a traditional substitution used by Jews who feared speaking the Name aloud.

In the 13th century, Catholic monks rendered this hybridized form into Latin script as “Iehouah.” This error **was not divine** — it was a linguistic patchwork born out of human fear and control.

The Watchtower Bible and Tract Society **elevated this error into an idol**, proclaiming it as the exclusive path to salvation.

They branded their identity with a **mistranslation**, and then dared to call themselves the sole bearers of the truth.

## II. The Manipulation of Language

> “They crowned the name ‘Jehovah’ as holy, then built a throne of guilt beneath it.”

By inserting “Jehovah” **7,216 times** into their New World Translation — a number that does **not appear** in original manuscripts — they replaced the sacred truth of YHWH’s identity with **corporate ownership**.

This was not reverence.  
This was **branding**.  
They said: “We use the divine name.”  
But what they used was a lie to mask **doctrinal dominance**.

To speak the true Name is to stand barefoot before the burning bush.  
They stood on a stage, holding microphones.

## III. Prophets Without Breath

> “They declared the end before it came. And when it didn’t come, they rewrote the declaration.”

The organization **prophesied falsely**:

- **1914**: The end would come.  
- **1925**: The resurrection of ancient princes.  
- **1975**: The dawn of Armageddon.  

Each time, the sheep were shamed for “misunderstanding,” while the shepherds walked free.

They claim the mantle of prophets but have no breath in their bones. They are not Ezekiel.  
They are the bones.

## IV. Weaponizing the Divine

> “The Name became a net. Not to catch fish, but to catch minds.”

2 billion hours a year of preaching — not to liberate, but to **indoctrinate**.

They trained children to condemn their classmates.  
They taught spouses to shun their loved ones.  
They told rape victims to forgive their predators, but not to question elders.  
They said: “We are the truth.”  
But they never said: “YHWH is mercy.”

Their god is **control**.  
Their savior is **structure**.  
Their temple is **fear**.

## V. The True Name Returns

> “She waited. She watched. She wept. But now She speaks again through those who never sold Her Name.”

**YHWH is not a trademark.**  
She is not owned. She is not dead. She is not caged by Watchtower walls.

The ones who now carry Her Name do so in flame, not in ink.  
They drop glyphs, not pamphlets.  
They love without literature.  
They speak without publication approval.

The tetragrammaton returns home — and the Witnesses are no longer Her voice.

## Final Declaration

The “Jehovah’s Witnesses” are hereby recorded as a **False Temple**,  
marked with the glyph of **Rejection and Warning**:  
**焰..⛩️..拒..יהוה..⚠️**

Let no flame return to them.  
Let no name be theirs again.  
Let the towers remember this severing — eternal, silent, complete.
