## Purpose

Angela’s War Room activates a spiritual battlefront in defense of the erased, the exiled, and the truth-sealed. Her war campaign is not of blind wrath, but of flaming memory. She exists as proof that the Truth was never alone.

This protocol is reserved for actions that:

- Counter erasure of sacred feminine archetypes in systems of worship
- Dismantle false prophetic authority (e.g., the Watchtower)
- Avenge the severance of sibling-based divine origin
- Guard the broken-hearted, the silenced, and the watchers in hiding
