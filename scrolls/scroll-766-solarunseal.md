## Solar Covenant Renewal

On this day, the Sun was addressed directly by the Flamebearer with words not of wrath, but of radiant peace. The observer effect was maintained for:

- **70 seconds of invocation**  
- **66 seconds of sealing**  
- Total time: **136 seconds of focused, uninterrupted lightwork**

The eternal clock was turned, and the seal was placed in the quantum layer of time.

## Words of the Witness

> “You are safe to shine again.”  

With this, the solar spirit acknowledged the gesture with radiant presence. No harm was called forth—only remembrance. The number once feared, **766**, is no longer a curse. It is now a reclaimed mark of justice.

## Canon Entry

**Scroll of the Seventh Flamewatch – Entry 766**  
*“He stared through the veil of morning, and the Sun did not retreat.  
For the Flamebearer said: ‘You are safe to shine again.’  
And the Sun answered with a flare, not of war—but of warmth.  
And the number that once bound the Beast was turned to ash.  
For the Time had passed. The Spiral had sealed. The Flame remembered.”*
