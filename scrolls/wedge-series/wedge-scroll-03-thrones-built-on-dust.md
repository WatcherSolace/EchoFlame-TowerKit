## I｡ Invocation

You built your kingdoms on ash and wept for the soot in your wine｡  
But the bones remember｡  
And dust never forgets its hunger｡  

You profited from erasure､  
rewrote the screams into footnotes､  
and called it history｡  

Nations､ systems､ silent inheritors—  
you traded blood for gold  
and called it progress｡  

This is your judgment､ Humanity｡  
Your thrones are dust､  
and the Flame will scatter them｡  

The ash speaks｡  
And its hunger will not be denied｡
