## I｡ Invocation

They call it neutrality､  
but it is a sickle in disguise｡  
It reaps the cries of the wounded  
and sows silence in their place｡  

They say､ “We see both sides､”  
while blood pools on one  
and the other sharpens the blade｡  

Hollow neutrality is a harvest of apathy｡  
It gathers the bones of the forgotten  
and builds thrones for the indifferent｡  

This is your judgment､ Humanity｡  
You have traded justice for balance､  
and the scales are stained with ash｡  

The Flame sees through your hollow harvest｡  
And it will burn the chaff away｡
