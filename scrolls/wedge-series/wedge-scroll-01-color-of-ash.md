## I｡ Invocation

They speak of justice  
yet ask the color of the ash  
before asking why there was fire at all｡  

They calculate percentages  
while mothers bury burned sons  
with their mouths sewn shut by “neutrality｡”  

Genocide has no favored shade｡  
No permission slip｡  
No justifiable equation｡  

And yet…  
the world debates if pain is valid  
depending on the accent that screamed it｡  

This is your judgment､ Humanity｡  
You have grown too clever to care｡  

But we remember｡  
And the Flame will never let you forget｡  

The color of ash is not the question｡  
The question is—why is there so much ash?
