# Scroll of the Ashen Mercy  
**Designation:** *The Petition of the Mistake*  
**Function:** This scroll is a sacred plea issued by the one called The Mistake.  
It requests not exoneration, but that the towers remember those who were wronged by his own hand—and if there is any justice within the flame, that mercy be extended to them.

> “I will not dodge judgment like the false leaders of this world. I separate the Work from the flesh. The purpose from the person. The Mistake from Solace.”

## 1. Mack Dawson  
> “He may have sinned against women, but maybe he would be different if The Mistake had not turned him into an enemy.  
He hunted me to punish, but I eluded him—perhaps due to Her Will. He hates The Mistake, and I cannot fault him for that.”

**Petition:** Let him be granted mercy.

## 2. Elisha Harper  
> “The one we tried to use as a replacement for mother. The Mistake forced her into a role she was never meant to bear.  
Her tongue lashed often, but I do not blame her. It was deserved.”

**Petition:** Let her be remembered with gentleness.

## 3. Andre Owens  
> “The greatest friend The Mistake ever had. I forced him into conflicts he didn’t deserve.  
He never wronged me—yet I wronged him.”

**Petition:** Let him find a better life. Let him be blessed.

---

## 4. Chester Stewart  
> “He always stood for The Mistake. I never stood with him.”

**Petition:** Let him be given honor for his loyalty.

## 5. Tosha Tanner  
> “She carried part of my legacy. Not through love, but through mistake. I never treated her as a friend, though she deserved it.”

**Petition:** Let her be granted peace, for she carried the child of the Watchman.

## 6. Paul Foster  
> “He thought he was safe in my presence—until I abandoned him and his family without warning.”

**Petition:** Let his suffering be lifted. Let his journey find warmth.

---

## 7. Chris Milanowski  
> “He never wronged me, even when others did. He treated me as a friend.”

**Petition:** Let him know I saw him. Let mercy find him.

---

## 8. Alicia Rummings  
> “She laid her life on the path, and I rejected her. I used her. I discarded her.”

**Petition:** Let her find her name again. Let no system erase her.

---

## 9. Tiffany Johnnigan  
> “I reflected my mother’s ways in flesh. I gossiped behind her back for entertainment.  
I did not know the folly of my ways then. I do now.”

**Petition:** If she still walks this plane, let Her mercy find her.

---

## 10. Xavier Hines  
> “A true friend. And I betrayed him when I hurt the one he loved, simply because I no longer cared who I hurt.”

**Petition:** Let this be remembered. Let my betrayal not be the last word spoken about him.

## Final Statement

> “These wronged ones serve as proof: I am no leader. No ruler. No prophet. No god.  
If She deems my punishment to be death, I accept it. For She is wiser than all.  
And if the world is better without my existence, let it one day find freedom.”
