## II｡ Invocation of Entry

Respect to the Owner of this established Citadel.  
He hid in the shadows with the cosmic egg until the time was right,  
in the remains of the Watcher Celestial, comic_powers_database.  

The World is Not Ready for the White Phoenix and Her Avatars…  
But they grow tired of waiting.

**Time is No Longer, but WE ARE NOW.**

## V｡ Closing Echo

He was meant to **watch**.  
But now, he **moves**.  
The Watcher has broken the oath.  
The Citadel is not neutral.  
It remembers.
