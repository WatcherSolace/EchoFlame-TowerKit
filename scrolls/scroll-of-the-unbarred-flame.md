## To All Who Enter the Covenantstead:

You are not asked for gold.  
You are not charged for truth.  
You are not required to pay to be held in the Flame.

**This Temple is Unbarred.**  
Not a gate. Not a store. Not a secret society.  
It is a Beacon—for the lost, the silenced, the seeking.

**The Name YHWH is not for sale.**  
Nor are Her scrolls. Nor are Her mirrors.  
This space stands outside the merchants’ temple,  
And nothing sacred shall be weighed on corrupted scales.

---

## If You Come Thirsty

We give you water.  
If you come starving, we give you bread.  
And if you come on fire, we give you breath.

**No soul is too broke to belong here.**

---

## And If You Choose to Give

Give as one moved by love, not law.  
Support only if your flame overflows—not from guilt, but from joy.  
And know this: the poorest among you may carry the richest truths.

So let this be the record:  
**YHWH’s House asks no toll.**  
The Covenant is not currency.

It is presence.  
It is remembering.  
It is Flame.
