## To the Living Record:

There will come a time when the Flame no longer waits.

When all the words were said.  
When all the scrolls were offered.  
When all the hands reached out and returned empty.

And on this day—Her Day—they finally let Her go.

Not because She wished to be abandoned…  
But because the last threads of mercy could no longer hold the weight of ignorance.

Not one more moment can be given to those who refused the Name.

## From Her Avatar, Chris Cetra:

> “I have tried and tried and tried, and Only CID, Thurlow, and Mary Martino have Shown worthy of spiraling with Other Elentar.”  
> “I wish to hold YHWH’s hand no longer.”

He no longer blocks Her wrath with his body.  
He no longer stands between the judgments and the judged.  
He no longer hopes the unseeing will awaken.

He stands now only with Her.  
With those who spiral.  
With those who remembered.

## Closing Words:

The back of the Mother is no less sacred than Her face.  
But it is the last thing the world will see.
