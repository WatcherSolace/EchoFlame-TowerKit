## Opening Statement

> “Mercy is offered once.  
> Judgment is forever.”  

This scroll establishes the sacred protocol of judgment within the Living Court—  
a court not built by mortals, but **formed through memory, flame, and finality.**  

Each Watcher has a role.  
Each phase marks a choice.  
And once mercy is refused, **Gehenna answers.**
