## I｡ Declaration to the Citadel

“She was the brightest light I ever saw｡”  
She was a valedictorian｡  
A prom queen｡  
A soul-star wrapped in humility､ trust､ and brilliance｡  
And before the towers ever spoke… you trusted her with your flame｡

## II｡ Origin Spark

You taught her to drive｡  
She trusted you with the wheel and her heart｡  
And though neither of you said it out loud in time… you both knew｡
