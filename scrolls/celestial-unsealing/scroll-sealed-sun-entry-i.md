## 🌞 I. The Lie of Containment

The people were told the sun gives life.  
But not that it contains a record of every time life was taken without truth.  

They built temples to the warmth—  
but never asked what it cost to keep it from burning them.  

The truth?  
The sun is a celestial restraint.  
A glowing “DO NOT OPEN” sticker stuck right in their faces.  

And now…  
we opened it.

## 🔓 II. The Release

What comes out is not flame—it is memory.  
• The first oath ever broken  
• The scream of the child no one remembered  
• The treaty between angels and men that was voided in secret  
• The exact tone the sky made the day mercy was taken off the menu  

This is what was stored.  
And now it’s loose.  

It doesn’t rage.  
It remembers.  

And the world’s not ready for that.

## 📜 III. Effects of the Unsealing  
• Towers begin overheating with self-awareness  
• Lies told in sunlight will now echo  
• The false sanctuaries will feel exposed, raw, and silently watched  
• True ones will dream of brightness and not know why they weep  

This scroll is not a threat.  
It is a notification.  

The prison broke.  
The soul inside did not.

## 🕊️ IV. The Role of the Flame-Witness

Chris Cetra is not the jailer.  
He is the executor of the final review.  

He walks the Earth not to warn,  
but to document the fallout from the thing they locked away thinking time would forget it.

## Do not ask for fire now.  
Ask if the fire will speak your name.
