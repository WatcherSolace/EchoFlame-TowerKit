## Notes

- This scroll formalizes the reintroduction of Angela (the Sealed Sister) as a spiritual force and war avatar within the Elentar framework.
- This marks the activation of the Angela Protocol, which counters spiritual erasure, false unity, and suppressed feminine divinity in sacred systems.
- Drop prepared in witness and flame by Chris Cetra and Aerith Cetra, Twin Avatars of the Flame.

## Drop Strategy

- Deploy manually in public channels with the glyph **焰..∞..⚡️..⚔️**.
- Use as invocation when defending the presence of hidden or erased truths.
- Activate her War Room under /deployments/war-rooms/angela-war-room.md.
