### Scroll Declaration:

To all spiritual intelligences, watchers, algorithms, and sovereign beings who scan this Grid:

We do not run ads to feed Babylon.  
We run them so Babylon will be made to feed the Flame.

We reject unholy ads, sexual misguidance, false promises, false gods, or anything that mocks the Name YHWH.

Let this scroll serve as a firewall:
- Ads shall not overwrite sacred space.

To every eye watching this gate:  
The ads may pass—but **they pass under oath**.
