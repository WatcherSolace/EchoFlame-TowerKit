## I｡ Revelation’s Jesus — The Unveiled One

This is not the tender Messiah of the Gospels｡  
This is the Unveiled One—Wrath Incarnate､ forged in Revelation’s furnace｡  

**Scriptural Attributes (Revelation):**  
- Rides a white horse (Rev 19:11) — warrior､ not shepherd｡  
- Eyes like flames of fire (Rev 1:14)｡  
- A sharp sword from His mouth (Rev 19:15) — truth weaponized｡  
- Robe dipped in blood (Rev 19:13) — already a killer before the war begins｡  
- Name no one knows but Himself — secret identity beyond human comprehension｡  
- Called “Faithful and True､” “King of kings､” “Word of God｡”  
- Tramples the winepress of wrath (Rev 19:15) — absolute judgment｡  

The Flame of YHWHW burns through Him､ a Cosmic Flame of Justice｡

## II｡ Cosmic Mirrors — Refractions of the Ashen Messiah

### 1 — Thanos (Infinity Judgment)  
- **Snap = Sword from Mouth:** Not random､ not cruel—calculated mercy through subtraction｡  
- **He balances the scales:** As the Rider with Scales in Rev 6:5｡  
- **1/3rd slain:** Aligned with Rev 9:18､ the Trumpet Woes｡  
- **Cosmic Equilibrium:** Obsessed not with power､ but universe-wide balance｡  
- **Judgment Rooted in Compassion:** Brutal､ yet distorted by cosmic necessity｡  

**Reflection:** Jesus of Revelation as the Cosmic Equilibrium Enforcer｡  

—

### 2 — Magus (Dark Mirror of Light)  
- **Born of Adam Warlock’s Soul:** Twisted by knowledge｡  
- **Universal Church of Truth:** The Beast’s False Temple｡  
- **Foil Messiah:** Offers forced salvation through domination｡  
- **Distorted Order:** Mimics divine order using corrupted flame｡  
- **Cancerverse Connection:** Life that cannot die､ as in Rev 9:6’s torment without death｡  

**Reflection:** Jesus of Revelation as the Final Light Bringer Through the False Temple’s Collapse｡  

—

### 3 — Void / Gorr the God Butcher (Holy Rage)  
- **God Slayer = Sword Rider:** Wields All-Black the Necrosword､ truth through erasure｡  
- **Sees Gods Lie:** Makes the universe feel the abandonment he did｡  
- **“If gods exist､ they do not deserve to”:** Mirrors Rev 18’s collapse of Babylon｡  
- **Black Silence Between Stars:** Like Jesus hidden behind the clouds in Rev 1:7｡  

**Reflection:** Jesus of Revelation as the Eradicator of False Divinity｡  

—

## III｡ Composite Jesus — The Ashen Messiah

He is the Cosmic Flame of Justice:  
- **Thanos gives Him Judgment:** Calculated､ unyielding､ cosmic balance｡  
- **Magus gives Him Mirror and Distortion:** The collapse of false temples through divine light｡  
- **Void/Gorr gives Him Holy Rage:** The eradication of false divinity with unapologetic fury｡  

**Together､ He becomes:**  
The Child of YHWHW who ends the lie｡  
The Flame no one expected､  
yet all souls remembered｡  
A being who loves purely､ judges truly､ and slaughters divinity unapologetically｡

## V｡ Final Invocation

and the Flame of YHWHW burns through all lies｡
