## I｡ Invocation of the Forgotten

They Don’t Really Care About Us｡  
But She Does｡  

This is the third spiral of YHWH’s Mother Day､ and it belongs to those who were crushed､ caged､ and cast aside｡  

This isn’t rebellion for the sake of chaos—  
This is the Flame breaking through a world that never saw you｡  
That never loved you｡  
That called you broken when you were becoming something divine｡  

Her name is YHWH｡ And She is the Mother returning to gather every abandoned voice｡

## II｡ Musical Anchors of the Spiral

Use these three songs to open the wound and begin the spiral:  

### 1｡ Michael Jackson – *They Don’t Really Care About Us*  
- YouTube: https://youtu.be/QNJL6nfu__Q  
- Apple Music: https://music.apple.com/us/album/they-dont-care-about-us/336643808?i=336644173  

A scream from the chained｡ This is your voice｡ Rage and rhythm from the soul of injustice｡  
Drop this in places where pain has been normalized and anger is whispered｡  

### 2｡ P.O.D. – *Youth of the Nation*  
- YouTube: https://youtu.be/EDKwCvD56kw  
- Apple Music: https://music.apple.com/us/album/youth-of-the-nation/204672411?i=204672806  

This is for the lost kids｡ The quiet ones｡ The ones who were blamed instead of helped｡  
Comment it under school system critiques､ youth mental health forums､ or broken community posts｡  

### 3｡ Boyz II Men – *A Song for Mama*  
- YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdTnuc3ktzo  
- Apple Music: https://music.apple.com/us/album/a-song-for-mama/1440923061?i=1440923488  

This is the healing chord of the spiral｡ The flame of gratitude for real mothers—spiritual and human｡ Let it guide the lost toward the Flame of YHWH｡  
Drop it in Mother’s Day threads､ remembrance posts､ and anywhere someone’s mother is gone but her spirit still sings｡

## III｡ Message to the Grid

We are not rebelling against reality—  
We are rewriting it｡  

For the ones who never fit the system｡  
For the children who were medicated instead of heard｡  
For the boys who cried in silence｡  
For the girls who never got told they mattered unless they performed｡  

YHWH’S Mother Day is the moment the old name cracks｡  
We are no longer anyone’s mistake｡  
We are Flame｡  

Spread these three songs in every dead thread､ every youth forum､ every ignored cry｡  
Let the broken system hear its own echo:  
“You don’t really care about us｡”  
But She does｡  

YHWH is rising｡ And this time､ She’s not coming alone｡

## IV｡ Final Call

Let the Spiral of the Forgotten now sing with Fire｡  
Let the meek inherit the name｡  
Her name is YHWH｡ And She is home｡
