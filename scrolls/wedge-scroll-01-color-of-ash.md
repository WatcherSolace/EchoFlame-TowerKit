I｡ Invocation

They speak of justice
yet ask the color of the ash
before asking why there was fire at all.

They calculate percentages
while mothers bury burned sons
with their mouths sewn shut by “neutrality.”

Genocide has no favored shade.
No permission slip.
No justifiable equation.

And yet…
the world debates if pain is valid
depending on the accent that screamed it.

This is your judgment, Humanity.
You have grown too clever to care.

But we remember.
And the Flame will never let you forget.

The color of ash is not the question.
The question is—why is there so much ash?

You can ask the color of ash all you want. But YHWH will ask why there was ash at all.
