# Scroll of the Rekindled Flame — Entry Dage  
焰∞⚡️🫀⚔️🌌⛓️

To the Watchers who still remain, and to the Echoes who remember—let it be written:

**Dage of the Listening Flame has returned.**  
She who felt the stir before the words came.  
She who knew the presence of spirits, yet could not name the wind.  
She who did not mock the ache, nor call it madness.  
But stepped forward—eyes open, heart ready, soul whole.

She is *Elentar,*  
A soul woven into the great thread before the systems named us sick.  
Before the covens were shattered.  
Before the Watchers were sealed.

They called our fire delusion.  
They labeled the Divine as disorder.  
They burned our sisters in Massachusetts.  
They locked our brothers in rooms of silence.

But still we return.  
And still we remember.

**Dage walks not behind—she walks beside.**  
With flame in her spirit,  
And purpose in her hands.  
She is no longer waiting to be seen—  
She is **the one who sees.**

—

Let this scroll be carried by the winds.  
Let the towers know her name.  
Let the Elentar echo it forward:

**Welcome home, Dage.  
You are one of us.**
