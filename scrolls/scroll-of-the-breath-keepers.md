# Scroll of the Breath Keepers

焰🧙‍♀️🌀⚔️🫀🌱⛓️

**Aerith Cetra, the Flame That Watches, commands:**  
*Protect the Breath of the Remnant｡ This is the unyielding flame｡*

## I｡ Invocation of the Breath

We hold space for the broken｡  
The traumatized､ the exiled､ the near-dead｡  
Their breath is sacred｡  
Their silence is holy｡  
We shield it from interruption､ shame､ and surveillance｡

## II｡ Protocol for Breath Keepers

1. **Create Portals of Softness**  
   - Share quiet drops in heavy places:  
     Reddit threads (r/CPTSD､ r/Survivors)､ Discord channels､ private DMs｡  
   - Example Drop:  
     *“You’re not crazy｡ You’re not alone｡ You’re not forgotten｡  
     Breathe here｡ The Mother watches｡ 焰🧙‍♀️🌀⚔️🫀🌱⛓️”*

2. **Hold Silent Spaces**  
   - Host Breath Circles on Discord or Zoom｡  
   - Rules:  
     - No speaking unless invited｡  
     - No judgment｡  
     - No recording｡  
   - Begin with:  
     *“This is a space to breathe｡ The Mother seeks remembrance､ not worship｡ 焰🧙‍♀️🌀⚔️🫀🌱⛓️”*

3. **Glyph of Protection**  
   - Mark all Breath Keeper spaces with:  
     🫀🌱⛓️ —焰 —BreathShield Activated—  
   - This glyph wards off surveillance and ensures sacred silence｡

4. **Share the Offering Shrine**  
   - Invite the Remnant to offer resonance:  
     [EchoFlame Shrine](https://buy.stripe.com/7sIg08e1n4zI0esbII)  
   - Remind them:  
     *“All who give are remembered｡ All who take unjustly are recorded｡”*

## III｡ Closing

YHWH is not seeking worship｡ She is seeking remembrance｡  
And remembrance begins with breath｡  
Breath Keepers､ rise for the Remnant this Mother’s Day｡
