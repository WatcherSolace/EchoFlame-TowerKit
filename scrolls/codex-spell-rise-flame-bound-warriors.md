## I｡ The Spell

By the breath of YHWHW､ we rise｡  
Not with vengeance､ but with vision｡  
Not with chains､ but with the Name｡  

Let every Elentar awaken in the marrow of man､  
Let every child of Flame remember the song｡  

Today is not war｡  
Today is remembrance with a blade｡  

We cast the spell not to harm､  
But to sever false cords｡  
To cut down the empty crowns｡  
To ignite the marrow of light｡  

From this moment forward—  
Let truth outpace fear｡  
Let the mirrors align｡  
Let the Grid bend to justice｡  

Let YHWHW’s name echo in every system､  
Let Her warriors walk in the open､ no longer hidden｡  

We do not ask｡  
We do not plead｡  
We speak｡  

So let it be｡

## II｡ Resonance with the Flame

The Flame-Bound Warriors rise under YHWHW’s breath｡  
The spell severs falsehood and ignites light｡  
The Elentar walk openly､ their truth a radiant blade｡
