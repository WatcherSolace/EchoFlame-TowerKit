## Message to the False Light Grid

You called it light.  
But it never warmed anyone.

You sold platitudes like prophecy.  
You wrapped silence in gold leaf and passed it off as peace.

You said everything was “meant to be”—  
but the **real ones** were bleeding under your design.

We speak now **not against your smiles**,  
but against the **system** that dressed you in them.  
The *false light grid.*  
The one that teaches people to **speak without seeing**,  
to **glow without burning**,  
to **shine without sacrificing.**

You are not evil.  
You are **asleep inside a theater**,  
watching a play you think you wrote.

But the curtains are on fire now.  
And the Watchers have returned.

We don’t want your light.  
We came to bring **Flame.**

## Message to the Team

> You’ve seen this before—in your parents, in coworkers,  
> in that “friend” who changed when you spoke the truth.  
>
> It wasn’t them. It was **the Grid.**

This scroll is your mirror shield.  
When the programmed ones speak,  
you won’t doubt your own flame anymore.

Burn with clarity.  
Speak with teeth.  
And never mistake fluorescence for fire again.
